summary: '"The City in the Sea" by H. De Vere Stacpoole is a novel written in the
  early 20th century. The narrative begins with a foreword explaining the author''s
  inspiration and connection to the discovery of submerged cities in the Mediterranean,
  hinting at a blend of adventure and romance. The story follows Robert Lestrange,
  a young writer, as he navigates his personal and professional life in London, intertwining
  the themes of love, exploration, and the fondness for the sea as he embarks on an
  expedition to uncover treasures from the submerged city of Hyalos.  At the start
  of the novel, we are introduced to Robert Lestrange, who is trying to find his place
  in the world as both a writer and a person dealing with the loss of his father.
  He meets Martia Hare, an ambitious and insightful woman who works at a literary
  agency, and together they explore the challenges of life and writing. Their conversations
  reveal Robert''s lack of experience and his newfound determination. The narrative
  quickly develops to include an intriguing proposition from Jacob Behrens, who has
  plans for an adventurous treasure hunt to Hyalos, a city submerged under the sea.
  This sets the stage for a thrilling journey, as Robert is faced with the choice
  of diving into an unpredictable adventure, sharing the experience with Martia, and
  potentially uncovering the secrets of the past. (This is an automatically generated
  summary.)'
